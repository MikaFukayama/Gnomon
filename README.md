World War Two posters, and is made to display the capabilities of the OpenType variable font
system. This is version 1.0.

About
-----
Renner* was built from the ground up to work in the digital age. In designing 
Renner*, nothing about Paul Renner’s design for Futura was taken for granted. 
Letters were created to be the best possible iterations of themselves, while 
extreme precaution was taken to ensure that as a collective family, Renner* 
functions seamlessly. This has resulted in numerous notable differences between 
Renner* and Futura. Renner*’s weighting system is a bit different, to make it 
more inline with the typefaces of today. Renner* also has more balanced capital 
forms, for a better flow, especially at text sizes. It does this while retaining 
the elegance that defines Futura.
